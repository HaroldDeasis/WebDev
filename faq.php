	<p id = "_question">Do you have a size chart?</p>
	<p id = "_answer">For each and every product, there's a specific size chart. Just check their individual pages!</p>
	<p id = "_question">Well, is _________ still available?</p>
	<p id = "_answer">The designs you see in our store are all we have. No worries, though! We're always adding new designs for your convenience!</p>
	<p id = "_question">I've ordered the wrong size! Will I be able to replace it?</p>
	<p id = "_answer">Unfortunately, once you ordered your size, replacing it is just not possible anymore. This is why we got the size chart, dude! So problems like this won't exist.</p>
	<p id = "_question">Do you give refunds?</p>
	<p id = "_answer">No idea why you would let go of such a killer product... but we don't offer refunds. BUT... if we shipped the wrong size to you, you can have it replaced with any item with the same price. If there's no item with the same price, let us know. We can talk about that!</p>
	<p id = "_question">Don't you have a store near my place? I'm nervous to order online!</p>
	<p id = "_answer">Our online store is one of the best in the country - along with our customer service! Unfortunately, we are only available Online for now.</p>
	<p id = "_question">How do I order?</p>
	<p id = "_answer">Here's how you order. Just click the item you want to purchase, add it to your cart, once you're done shopping just fill up the form for billing statement. AND... you're done!</p>
	<p id = "_question">I'm ready to pay now! How do I do it?</p>
	<p id = "_answer">We have five different payment methods you can choose from, man! BPI and BDO Bank Deposit, Palawan Express, LBC and, available only in Metro Manila, Cash on Delivery! WOOT! We just want to remind you that you should check your e-mail right after ordering for the next steps. This is really important! Follow it, and you'll get your order in no time!</p>
	<p id = "_question">I just bought and paid for a product... where should I send the payment slip?</p>
	<p id = "_answer">Just e-mail a photo of your payment slip alongside your valid ID to pupclothinglinetrasnsactions@gmail.com. Remember, you can't send it to our Facebook account since it'll just mess up the whole system. If you don't have an e-mail account, go ahead and contact us and let's resolve your problem together as friends.</p>
